    "## Questions\n",
    "1. - Large population size: Using a large population size increases computational cost due to the requirement of more computational resources and time. It also increases the likelihood of convergence of the population in the first steps and generations, so the algorithm won't explore the search space enough. Additionally, it makes it hard to identify the actual optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Small population size: becuase of less diversity and slower exploration of the search space the algorithm requires more generation to converge and being closer to the optimal answer. With a small population size, there are fewer potential solutions being evaluated each generation. Random variations or mutations between generations could cause promising solutions to be lost if they are not represented elsewhere in the population. A small population will converge more quickly, losing diversity earlier in the search. Without enough diverse solutions, the algorithm is more likely to converge to a local optimum (a high-scoring but suboptimal solution) rather than finding the global or true best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increasing the population size in each step may increase the accuracy because it increases diversity and the algorithm has less probability to get stuck in local maxima. However, with a larger population size, each step will require more memory and time consumption and we may have some limits in memory and time. We should get the result in a reasonable time within a certain memory space. Additionally, with more diversity it may become harder for the algorithm to converge and find the optimal result.\n",
    "3. Crossover combines two chromosomes to create new chromosomes for the next generation and create variation. Mutation changes a chromosome to get rid of local maxima. If we only use crossover, we will have a much higher probability of getting stuck in local maxima and not finding the optimal result. And if we only use mutation, our algorithm works like a brute force approach and it will be very hard to get the optimal result. So it is not possible to use only one of them because they have different effects.\n",
    "4. Initialize the population with candidate curves seeded by performing a fast linear regression fit on the data, rather than randomly generating curves. This provides the genetic algorithm with a head start by starting with curves that have already been fit to the data.\n",
    "5. Some possible reasons are:\n",
    "The probabilities of crossover and mutation may be too small that it's not enough to cause significant changes to the chromosomes along the way.\n",
    "It's possible that the initial population has been selected in a way where the individuals are too similar, or that when they are gathered together they naturally follow similar paths and over time become even more similar without enough variation being introduced.\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can increase the probabilities of crossover and mutation to introduce more variation into the chromosomes. We can also repeat the algorithm multiple times with new random initial populations to avoid getting stuck in this problem. \n",
    "6. we can set a limit for the number of generation will evaluate by algorithm. like how we did in our algorithm and have a hyperparameter called *max_generation*.\n",
    "7. As the degree of the polynomial increases, the time taken to find the coefficients of the polynomial increases. This is because as the number of genes increases, the number of states related to the equation increases (considering the range of coefficients of the problem). The algorithm requires more time to guess and find the equation through operations such as crossover and mutation.\n",
    "8. As the number of data points given increases, we may be able to more accurately guess the polynomial, but more time is required. This is because, for example, checking each point for every chromosome takes a lot of time. On the other hand, if the number of data points given is less, our accuracy decreases and it is even possible that the number of points may not be sufficient to guess the polynomial. However, we may be able to reach an answer with a fitness of 1 faster, which may or may not be our desired answer."
